// Quick note I was able to complete Milestone 2 on Tuesday 24th March (As seen with the git repo)
// I was unable to complete this earlier due to being unable to go to uni to use a mac, and needing to get my own mac sorted to be able to preview it in the first place, hence why the last submission was half complete
// Further submissions should be fine due to having a mac at home which can now run xcode.
// Sorry about this

// Please note I was exploring Pods as a dependancy helper, and in doing so installed a pod file, but never used it in this project

//Core Data Struct, to be moved to its own file. Please note, my working was that if I save the whole array in the core data file it will save time. However I am aware and understand that, like sql, you can have multiple objects in the same table.

// I did it this way as it means I wouldn't have to change most of my code, plus helps me test if it is working before I was to change all the code

// Ignore this for now, worked on coredata before json as I got confused with the milestones, leaving this here for future reference
