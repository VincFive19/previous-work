    <h3>Peer Review Reflection</h3>
    <p>With my peer review experience I have leanred many things, it is very useful to understand areas which I could improve on or stuff that I missed while doing the work, such as spelling errors or code errors which I didn't think of checking. It is also 
    very useful as I get to see how other people set out their code, allowing me to see the way that their code works giving me ideas on how I can improve my code, or give me knowledge in things I didn't know about previously, allowing me to know what I need to research further. 
    From these experiences I have improved the way that I review others by giving more detailed feedback, and helping others improve their code, letting them know what areas they could improve in. It is also good because
     with the peer review I am able to discuss the code with fellow peers to learn more ways to achieve tasks, and discussing the code helps solidify the theory and understanding of said code.</p>

    
    <h3>Overview of Website</h3>
    <p>The brief was to create a website much like Uber Eats and deliveroo, where Users could buy dishes from restaurants.
    To achieve the result I used laravels Eloquent ORM to create the databases, using migrations to create the actual databases, and using 
    seeding to make initial database data. Throughout the creation fo this I experienced many different things which I had not known about before, such as using cookies to display information
    to another page (Sessions) and how to properly use Laravel Eloquent and relationships between tables.
    <br>
    I wasn't able to complete two of the optional tasks due to running out of time, however I did attempt them and I have I idea of how I would achieve this. I also added a way for a restaurant to mark orders that they have sent, while also keeping all previous orders.</p>

    <h3>Assignment Completion Table:</h3>
    <p>Below is a table regarding all the stuff I was able to complete</p>
